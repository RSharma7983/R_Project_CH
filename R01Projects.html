            <h1>Chemical Engineering Department</h1>
            <p>
                Established in 1956, the Department of Chemical Engineering is one of the oldest Disciplines at BIT Sindri. 
                It grew over the years and set very high standards for educating aspiring Chemical Engineers and Scholars.
                The department offers a four-year B.Tech degree course and a Postgraduate program for an M.Tech degree with a specialization in Chemical Plant Design in Engineering.
                The National Board Of Accreditation (NBA) has accredited the B.Tech program for the next two years in 2021.
                The department features highly qualified and experienced faculties dedicated to teaching and promoting Research and Development in basic and advanced areas. Since its establishment,
                a well-balanced curriculum of theory and practice and well-equipped laboratories, such as the Unit operations lab, process control lab, Petroleum refinery engineering lab, and Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics lab, 
                have been its defining characteristics.
                Numerous contemporary instruments have been added to the laboratories to keep up with the rapidly evolving technologies.
                <br>
                The students graduating from the department are well-positioned in their fields in India and Abroad. Additionally, many students pursue higher education in India and foreign lands like Germany, Singapore, the USA, etc. Consequently,
                the Alumni network of the department is incredibly robust.

                Quimica is the annual technical Colloquium and an extended branch of the Chemical Engineering Department’s student body, dedicated to improving and encouraging students’ interests in the same field. It organizes the annual technical Colloquium and fest. It also has a team that regularly publishes blogs and content related to Chemical Engineering.

                The foundation of this organization was laid only by a few ambitious students of the department but now have a network of Professors, Qualified Professionals, Alumni, and Intellectuals related to Chemical Engineering.

                Some significant events conducted by the society include Shaastra, Tech Kriti, Advaita, Scintilla, and seminars on topics like Roadmap to MITACS and Future Career Prospects for Chemical Engineers.
